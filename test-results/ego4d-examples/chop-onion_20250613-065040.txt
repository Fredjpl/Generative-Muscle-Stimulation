LLM outputLLM output (recognition): 
 1. From the image, the main object of interest is a red onion resting on a small cutting board, along with two knives nearby (one paring knife with a green handle and one larger chef’s knife).

2. The object being prepared is the onion, which has a rounded shape, purplish-red outer skin, and a layered interior. In the photo, it appears to be roughly the size of a tennis ball (or slightly smaller), cut into a couple of sections on the board.

3. Since you are right-handed (based on your profile) and not currently holding the onion or knife with either hand, you’d typically secure the onion with your left hand while using a suitable knife in your right hand for chopping.

4. A red onion like this is commonly used in cooking to add both flavor and color to dishes. It has a slightly crisp texture when fresh and can be diced, sliced, or chopped into small pieces to suit a variety of recipes.

5. In this context, its primary function is culinary: you’ll peel away any remaining skin and chop it using a stable cutting grip, then add the chopped onion to your dish.

Movement/Chopping Suggestion (Right-Handed):
────────────────────────────────────
• Place the red onion flat on the cutting board to keep it stable.  
• Use your left hand to gently hold the onion in place, curling your fingertips underneath to keep them safe.  
• With your right hand (your dominant hand), grip the larger chef’s knife.  
• Slice off any remaining root or stem ends as needed.  
• Make vertical cuts, then horizontal cuts across the onion, adjusting the size of the pieces to your preference.  

Because you’re in Berlin, you can easily find fresh onions year-round in local markets, and red onions work wonderfully for many German-inspired dishes (or international recipes). Enjoy your meal preparation!
