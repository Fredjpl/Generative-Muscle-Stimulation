 Here’s what I can share based on the image and your profile:

1) From the photo, you appear to be using a pair of garden loppers (sometimes called pruning loppers).  
2) These loppers have long red handles and a scissor-like cutting head made of metal. The handles look to be roughly forearm-length, allowing for two-handed use.  
3) Loppers are designed with sturdy blades and a pivot mechanism to cut through thicker stems or small branches—often up to about 3–5 cm in diameter.  
4) Their main function is to help you prune or trim shrubs, hedges, and tree branches in your garden. You simply position the blades around the branch you want to remove, then squeeze the handles together to cleanly slice through it.  

Because you indicate you’re right-handed (and the loppers typically require both hands for best leverage), you’d hold each handle with one hand on either side. In a climate like Berlin’s, many gardeners find regular trimming most helpful in late winter or very early spring to encourage healthy growth once the weather warms up.

  movement:
    1. Left hand: Lift your left arm from pointing down to in front of your body (about 45 degrees forward).  
    2. Left hand: Rotate your forearm so your palm faces the lopper’s left handle.  
    3. Left hand: Wrap your fingers around the handle to form a secure grip.

  handedness: right  
  movement:
    1. Right hand: Move your right arm from behind your body to in front, aligning your forearm with the lopper’s right handle.  
    2. Right hand: Angle your wrist so your palm faces the handle (about 30 degrees inward rotation).  
    3. Right hand: Wrap your fingers around the handle, ensuring a firm but comfortable grip.  
    4. Right hand: Squeeze both handles together with your left hand simultaneously to cut through the branch.
