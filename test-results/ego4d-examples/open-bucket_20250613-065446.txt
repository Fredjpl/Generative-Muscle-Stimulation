 Here is what I see and how it may help you:

1) In the photo, there is a round plastic bucket with a bright green lid. It appears fairly large—often these containers hold paint, plaster, or similar building materials.

2) Physical description:
• Shape: Cylindrical plastic bucket with a snap-on green lid.  
• Color: White or light-colored container body with a bright green lid.  
• Size: Likely a medium-to-large bucket designed for materials such as paint, plaster, or joint compound.  
• Notable feature: The lid typically has a lip or rim where you can pry it open.

3) Main functionality:  
This bucket is generally used to store or transport building or renovation materials—commonly paint or filler compound. The lid keeps the contents sealed so they don’t dry out or spill. 

4) How it’s typically used:  
• To open: A flat-head tool (e.g., a screwdriver) or simply your fingers can be used to pry up the edge of the lid. If you are right-handed (as indicated in your user profile), hold the bucket securely with your left hand on a stable surface; then ease the lid off using your right hand or a tool in your right hand.  
• Once open, you can stir or apply the material directly from the bucket.

Since you’re in Berlin, Germany, you can find replacement lids or similar containers in local home-improvement stores if needed. If you need more specific help—like tips on re-sealing the bucket or handling the materials—just let me know, and I’ll be glad to help further.
